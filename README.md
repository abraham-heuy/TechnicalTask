### Task 1: Capitalize the First Letter of Each Word in a String

**Objective:**  
Write a program that accepts a string as input, capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string, and then returns the result.

**Functionality:**  
The program takes a string as input, processes it, and returns the string with each word's first letter capitalized.

**Examples:**
- Input: "hi" => Output: "Hi"
- Input: "i love programming" => Output: "I Love Programming"

**Requirements to Run:**  
- Python (any version 3.x)
- No external dependencies required
  ## Section 2: Frontend Development Challenge - Simple FAQ Accordion

### Task 2: Build a Simple FAQ Accordion

**Objective:**  
Create a basic FAQ accordion using only HTML and CSS. When a user clicks on a question, its answer becomes visible. If another question is clicked, the previous answer hides (accordion behavior).

**Functionality:**
- Each question is clickable, and clicking reveals the associated answer.
- The accordion hides previously opened answers when a new question is clicked.
- Mobile-first design with questions and answers stacked vertically on small screens.

**Requirements to Run:**  
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No external libraries or dependencies required (pure HTML/CSS)
- ## How to Run:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. For Task 1 (Python Program):
   - Navigate to the folder containing the Python file.
   - Run the Python file using the command:
     ```bash
     python <filename.py>
     ```
3. For Task 2 (Frontend Accordion):
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the FAQ accordion in action.
